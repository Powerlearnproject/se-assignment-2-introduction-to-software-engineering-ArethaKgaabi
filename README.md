# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: It is computer science that deals with designing, developing, testing and maintanance of computer softwares

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Software engineering deals with designing, developing, testing and maintanance of computer softwares with the help of SDLC which the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Waterfall model â€” is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project.

The agile model - refers to the iterative approach to delivering a software product. which means that instead of delivering a large project only when all parts are complete, a team breaks down a large project into smaller parts, and delivers these completed smaller parts in regular cycles.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
MODULARITY IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING - is a fundamental design principle in software engineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system.
Testing in Software Engineering:the process of checking the quality, functionality, and performance of a software product before launching.

Describe the different levels of software testing
-Unit testing - is the process where you test the smallest functional unit of code.
-Integration testing - is a type of software testing where components of the software are gradually integrated and then tested as a unified group
-System testing - the process in which a quality assurance team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application.
-Acceptance testing- is software testing that evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
SOFTWARE PROJECT MANAGEMENT - it is a process of leading the work of a team to achive all project goals within time, scope and budget.
-VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM- is the software engineering practice of controlling computer files and versions of files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file
POPULAR VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS

- GIT
- IBM
- CVC
- AZURE

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PROJECT MANAGER

- The project is on schedule
- Project is running within budget
- Ensure that project meet the required statndards
- Provide efficient resources
- Identify and mitigate Risks
- Meet the need and expections of stakeholders

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
SOFTWARE MAINTENACE -the process of modifying, changing, and updating a software system or module to resolve errors, improve performance, or adapt to a changing environment.

TYPES OF MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES
-Corrective Software Maintenance - addresses the errors and faults within software applications that could impact various parts of your software, including the design, logic, and code

-Preventative Software Maintenance - is to prevent the deterioration of your software as it continues to adapt and change

-Perfective Software Maintenance -involves the improvement of a software product by refining its functionality, enhancing its performance, and making the system more user-friendly

-Adaptive Software Maintenance - the implementation of changes in a part of the system, which has been affected by a change that occurred in some other part of the system

SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE IS ESSENTIAL because overtime engineers have to modify and update software applications after deployments to fix bugs and improve system performance

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
